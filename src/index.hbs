							Nestled in eastern Carlsbad, Leo Carrillo Ranch is a Historical &amp; National Park located approximately 40 miles north of San Diego.  Once a vacation ranch to actor Leo Carrillo, of mid 1950â€™s Hollywood fame, the park is meticulously landscaped and home to free roaming peacocks, and over 4 miles of walking trails.

					Both the ceremony and the reception will be held outdoors, so we recommend wearing layers to be comfortable in the afternoon sun, and also once the sun goes down. The 27 acres of this historical park is made of irregular earthen and paved surfaces. It is recommended that you wear appropriate shoes for the uneven terrain.
				</p>
				<p>
					The venue has a large parking lot, and there is ample space to park. It is a brief walk to the estate where the ceremony will be held, so please allow at least 5 minutes after parking to make your way to the ceremony. We encourage you to arrive early to explore the grounds and attempt to take a #peacockselfie.  There is no overnight parking allowed at the ranch, thus all cars must be moved by 11pm. Our reception will be over by 10pm. Look into taking provided transportation here.

				<h3>Registry</h3>
				<p>
					While gifts are unnecessary, we have assembled a registry per request of friends and family. We are not registered at any place in-particular, but do have a few items on a universal website located here: <a href="http://www.myregistry.com/public/kandjgethitched" target="_blank">http://www.myregistry.com/public/kandjgethitched</a>

				<h3>Add to Our Story</h3>
				<p>
					We politely ask that you refrain from cell phone use and taking photos during the actual ceremony (trust us, our photographer is really great and you'll all be able to download photos!), but we'd LOVE for you to take photos at the reception and share them using the <span class="hashtag">#katieandjoegethitched</span> hashtag across all social media!
