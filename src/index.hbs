							Nestled in eastern Carlsbad, Leo Carrillo Ranch is a Historical &amp; National Park located approximately 40 miles north of San Diego.  Once a vacation ranch to actor Leo Carrillo, of mid 1950’s Hollywood fame, the park is meticulously landscaped and home to free roaming peacocks, and over 4 miles of walking trails.

					Both the ceremony and the reception will be held outdoors, so we recommend wearing layers to be comfortable in the afternoon sun, and also once the sun goes down. The 27 acres of this historical park is made of irregular earthen and paved surfaces. It is recommended that you wear appropriate shoes for the uneven terrain. With the exception of immediate family members, we ask that no young children attend the ceremony or reception.
				</p>
				<p>
					The venue has a large parking lot, and there is ample space to park. It is a brief walk to the estate where the ceremony will be held, so please allow at least 5 minutes after parking to make your way to the ceremony. We encourage you to arrive early to explore the grounds and attempt to take a <a class="instagram-link" href="instagram://tag?name=peacockselfie" target="_blank"><span class="hashtag">#peacockselfie</span></a>.  There is no overnight parking allowed at the ranch, thus all cars must be moved by 11pm. Our reception will be over by 9pm. Look into taking <a href="#bus">provided transportation here</a>.

							Live in San Diego or staying downtown? Want to keep the party going after the reception? If you said yes to both of those, then we've got a bus for you! It will leave from downtown at 12:45pm to get everyone up to the venue on time for the ceremony, and after the reception will take everyone back downtown for more festivities. Exact location for pickup is TBD - sign up for the bus by September 30th so we know what size to get!

						<h4>Ashley Wooley</h4>
						<h5>Maid of Honor &amp; Sister</h5>
						<p>
							...well technically "sister-in-law", but she really is so much more to me than just "my brother’s wife", that I decided to drop the "in-law" indefinitely. I met Ashley at my brother’s apartment when they both attended the University of Idaho, and we’ve been causing a ruckus ever since. She’s been my voice of reason when I feel like I’m about to have a bridezilla meltdown, and will entertain me as I compare 10 shades of white during hour 8 of wedding dress shopping. She’s the smartest decision my brother has ever made, and I’m eternally grateful I get the reap the benefits.

						<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						<p>
							In the course of our lives, Courtney and I have been friends longer than we haven’t. When I think about the things in my youth that I probably shouldn’t haven got away with, Courtney was by my side, making sure that whatever plan we thought up, went smoothly. Her need for adventure has only grown with time, and whether she’s playing with Tigers in Thailand, or celebrating St. Patty’s day in Ireland, the distance has never hindered our near 2 decade bond.

						<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						<p>
							Thank goodness for unlimited data plans, I don’t think I could have survived without one. Despite living on opposite sides of the state in college, &amp; now opposite ends of the country for the entirety of our post collegiate lives, very few hours go by when we aren’t in touch. From the Southwest to the Northeast, a three hour time difference is nothing against our friendship. She’s my go-to for every "Guess what" and "You won’t believe this".

						<h4>Melissa Barham</h4>
						<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						<p>
							You know those horror stories about being paired up with the worst dorm-mate your freshmen year? I could’t tell you if they’re true or not, because I had the honest pleasure of sharing the most spacious 200 sqft dorm room with Melissa. Despite the fact it was haunted, and our window was inconveniently located right above the WSU marching band’s outdoor practicing alley... all of my favorite Pullman memories happened with Melissa in tow. From teaching me the "Soulja Boy" dance so I wasn’t left out at frat parties, to grabbing a slice of our favorite cake from the dining hall to save for me for later, I couldn’t imagine saying "I do" to my next life adventure without Melissa by my side.

						<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						<p>
							You don’t know what you’ve got till its gone, and its safe to say that Courtney and I took our sanity for granted before starting the Interior Design Program at Washington State.  It might have been the fumes from our rendering markers, or maybe having to scrape layers of ice off our windshields when we left our studio at 3am in the middle of December and it was -12 degrees, but struggling at life so immensely is completely doable when you have Courtney as a friend to tell you jokes and make you laugh when you feel like crying. I can always count on her to find the silver lining to any situation and I am so lucky to have her as the brightest ray of sunshine in my life.

						<h4>Kaitlin Lester</h4>
						<h5>Bridesmaid &amp; Aunt to Paul Ruffere</h5>
						<p>
							Would there be a "Katie &amp; Joe" without Kaitlin? Luckily I’ll never have to know. My biggest advocate before she even met me, Kaitlin has been Joe’s advice-gal and bestie since before I even called California "home".  She quickly went from "Joe’s friend" to one of my own as as we discovered that we were two Harry Potter loving, reality TV watching, bad joke laughing, birds of a feather. I always joke that the biggest perk of being with Joe, is getting Kaitlin too. You know those jokes that are actually serious, and not jokes at all.. well... that could be one of those jokes.
